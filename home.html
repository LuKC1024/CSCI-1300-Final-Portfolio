  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>
    I'm XXX, a graduate CS student at Brown University. Listed below are coursework projects of <a
      href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1300/">CSCI 1300</a>. I wish this course will benefit my research focus --
    enhancing the user experience of writing computer programs. Nowadays there are many online IDEs/editors. And some
    popular offline code editors, notable Visual Studio Code, are also powered by web techniques. So you can find an
    emphasis on the web in my projects. Writing programs is conceptually complicated. Thus it is critical that the UI
    conveys a correct mental model to users. Throughout my projects, I put a fairly high priority on the logical
    structure of UIs.

  <p>
    I hope you will enjoy looking at my projects!
