  <h1>Redesign the Popeyes Website</h1>
  <p>I found the <a href="https://www.popeyes.com">Popeyes</a> website has some usability problems so redesign it. This
    page describes the redesigning process.</p>
  <h2>Identify Usability Problems</h2>
  <figure id="fig-screenshot">

    <figcaption>
      <strong>Figure 1. Screenshot of the
        <a href="https://www.popeyes.com">Popeyes homepage</a>
      </strong>
      <p>The white bar at the top is the navigation bar. The
        first screen also includes 'ORDER PICKUP' and 'ORDER DELIVERY' buttons.
        The second screen highlights new events. The our-offers
        screen layouts coupons. The trending screen describes the popeyes'
        attitude toward COVID-19. The fan-favorites screen introduces people to
        products that they are most proud of. Finally, the last screen shows the
        buttons as the first screen. I identify useability and accessibility problems in the following paragraphs.</p>
      <p><em>The menu</em> is important for first-time users. Every time I
        visit a new restaurant, the first thing I do is to read their menu. I
        don't know if this behavior applies to everyone but I believe this is one
        of the most common first-time-users behavior. Unfortunately, the link to
        Popeyes'&nbsp;menu is surprisingly difficult to find. One link is at the
        end of the <em>fifth</em> screen. Another is in the navigation bar, under
        the <code>More</code> dropdown.</p>
      <p><em>Contrast of text and background</em> is poor, I would say, on
        this page. As we will point out soon in <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">​WebAIM WAVE​</a> analysis, some
        white texts on orangish or complicated backgrounds are difficult to read. This shortcoming hurts all kinds of
        users.</p>
      <p><em>Distracting elements</em> occur in several places. For instance, who cares about the shopping cart
        (top-right) before seeing the menu? The trending screen is also distracting. A single piece of information
        doesn't deserve a whole screen.
      </p>
      <p><em>Keep saying 'order'</em> even when it is not appropriate is another annoying point of this webpage. There
        are <strong>4</strong> 'ORDER NOW's on the second screen. Also, why should people order now if they want to
        'check out our new offers'?</p>
      <p><em>Poor layout</em> confuses first-time users and casual users. Look at the fan-favorite section, can you tell
        me in one second which text block is describing the chicken sandwich? I feel it difficult to associate pictures
        with their descriptions in this figure. Even worse, the last column contains the same information as the first
        but is displayed in the reversed order.</p>
      <p><em>Accessibility analysis</em> with WebAIM WAVE reviews 1 error, 5 contrast errors, and 5 alerts. Looks not
        too much? This is because WebAIM WAVE cannot even see the whole page! The page refreshes automatically,
        preventing WebAIM WAVE and screen readers to process it properly. Even in the limited visible information,
        WebAIM WAVE finds one contrast error about white text on the orangish background.</p>

  <h2 id="prototype">Prototype</h2>
  <p>
    To redesign the Popeyes website, I start by creating a low-fidelity prototype. This grayscale and simplistic
    prototype focuses on the overall structure of web content and summarizes solutions to the problems mentioned in the
    last
    section. Later I refine this prototype to create a high-fidelity prototype, which should give all details that
    should be presented in the final HTML implementation. I could have gone directly to HTML from the lo-fi prototype.
    But
    <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a> is an amazing tool that speeds up the refinement of prototypes and
    exploring alternative decisions on details.</p>
  <h3 id="low-fidelity_prototype">Low-fidelity Prototypes</h3>
  <p>The mockup (a Balsamiq JSON file) is available <a href="downloads/low-fidelity_prototype_balsamiq.json">here</a>.
  </p>

    <figcaption>
      <p><strong>Figure 2. Low-fidelity prototypes of the Popeyes webpage</strong> The left one is for large
        screens, such as desktops. The two prototypes in the right column are for tablets and mobile phones
        respectively.
        I circle key points with colored and dashed rectangles. Their corresponding annotations are as followed:</p>
      <p>
        <span style="color: #3465a4;">■</span>
        Links to the menu are made obvious.
        <span style="color: #ff4000;">■</span>
        The shopping cart icon is removed from the navigation bar because it means nothing before users choosing any
        food. I
        expect an icon for the cart to show up at the bottom right corner after a user adds an item to the cart. The
        position for the shopping cart is now for a sign-up button,
        for the convenience of first-time users.
        <span style="color: #00a933;">■</span>Whether users want to get their food by delivery or pick-up, they must
        enter an address first. So I think it would be convenient to raise the address input box to the first level. I
        also remove the word 'ORDER' because it occurred too frequently.
        <span style="color: #8d281e;">■</span> To achieve responsiveness, links in the navigation bar are gathered into
        a side navigation panel.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't forget the other problems. I improve the contrast of texts and their background, as we will see in the
        final section together with improved accessibility. The confusing fan-favorites screen is removed. If Popeyes
        want to show products they are proud of, they can use the images as the background of the first screen.

      </p>
      <p>The one for large screens is shown at the top. The three images at the bottom, from left to right, are the
        navigation
        bar for tablets and mobile phones, the main part of a tablet prototype, and the main part of a mobile prototype.
        A complete tablet (resp. mobile) prototype is the main part plus the navigation bar.
      </p>
      <p>The side navigation bar (only applicable to tablets and mobiles) should slide in from left to right once the
        button at the top-left corner is clicked. A user might tap other areas to put back the navigation bar.</p>
      <p>Another different thing in the header is the group of sign-up and log-in buttons. In non-large screens, only
        the log-in button is shown, and with a different style</p>
      <p>The gallery of fans' favorite foods (i.e. apple pie, chicken sandwich, and mashed potato) is shown with a
        square on mobile screens. Users may swap horizontally the shown picture to see others.</p>
      <p>To achieve responsiveness, the offers section should use a flexbox to contains the coupons.</p>
      <p>Finally, the buttons for adding foods to the cart are simpler on mobile screens. For each menu item, there
        should
        be two sets of buttons but only one set is shown on specific screen size.</p>
      <p>Please refer to the visual design style guide (next section) on how visual elements react to some other user
        actions.</p>

  <h2>Final Result</h2>
  <p>Here is <a href="new/index.html">the redesigned page</a>. The new page for Popeyes is responsive to different sizes
    of browsers and to font sizes. Furthermore, the redesigned webpage is more accessible on different devices -- no
    error or contrast error is reported by WebAIM WAVE.</p>
