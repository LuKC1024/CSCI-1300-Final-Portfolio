  <h1>A/B Testing</h1>
  <p>I am trying to improve a cacti shopping website. To find out whether my changes really
    improve user experience, I did an A/B Testing. Users are required to add cactus of $150
    or more values to the shopping cart.
  </p>

  <h2>Hypothesis Test</h2>
  <p>I run statistical tests for <em>Time to Complete</em> and <em>Return Rate</em> respectively.
    I expect version B to outperform version A in terms of time to complete. Both images, text descriptions,
    Add-To-Cart buttons,
    counts in the cart, and prices are better aligned. Furthermore, cacti items are placed in white boxes to clarify the
    border of each item. I believe the tidier layout of B would help users to perform their tasks more efficiently
    and more confidently.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Null hypothesis: </strong> the time to complete is not shorter in version B</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative hypothesis: </strong> the time to complete is shorter in version B</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I don't think the improvement in B would affect the return rate so I just test for equality.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Null hypothesis:</strong> the return rate is the same in two versions</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative hypothesis:</strong> the return rate is different in two versions</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>Every user is required to add products to the cart till the total price is over $150.
    Heroku, the platform where I deployed the website, logs user actions automatically.
    I will process these data in the following section. Here is the
    <a href="data/mylog.txt">complete log file</a>.</p>
  <h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
  <p>Heroku logs much more data than I want. I used the following bash commands to removed irrelevant data and
    transform the data into <a href="data/myfilteredlog.csv">a CSV file</a>
  </p>
  <figure><code>grep AB_TEST mylog.txt > myfilteredlog.txt
​tr ' ' ',' < myfilteredlog.txt > myfilteredlog.csv</code></figure>
  <p>This project is studying time to complete and whether users return to a shopping page after checking out.
    So I further process the data with <a href="data-processing-code/clean.py">a Python script</a>. The output
    is shown in the following table.

  <h2>Statistical Analysis</h2>
  <p>I performed an Independent Samples T-test to study the relationship between versions and time to complete.
    The t-score is <em>-1.16</em> and the p-value is <em>0.14</em>. These results mean that there isn't a
    statistically significant difference in time to complete between versions A and B. However, if they also suggest
    that the average time to complete seems to be lower in B. If the sample size is large enough, we might see a
    significant difference.
  </p>
  <p>Then I performed a χ² test to study the relationship between versions and whether users return after checking out.
    The χ² value is <em>0.90</em> and the p-value is <em>0.34</em>. These results mean that there isn't a
    statistically significant difference in the probability of returning from the checkout page between versions A and B.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>My sample size might be too small (20) to produce statistically significant results.</li>
    <li>Heroku limits the log to 1500 lines, which in turn limits the sample size.
      I should consider increasing the limit or logging less irrelevant data.</li>
    <li>I want to increase the sample size before making more conclusions.</li>
  </ul>
